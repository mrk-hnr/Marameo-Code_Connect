## Optimizations

1. <strike>Footer Styling</strike>
2. <strike>Responsive Header/Nav</strike>
   - Create functional burger menu on Week 3 (JS)
3. <strike>Footer Flag Spacing on Responsive</strike>
4. Further organize classes name in accordance with the [BEM Naming Convention](https://getbem.com/naming/)
   - Maximize potential shared atoms/components and further optimize reusable codes as a result of organizing classes
5. Change class naming convention from camelCase to kebab-case

## Notes

1. navi-hover put on display: none, and then display:block on havi-(linkname) on hover
   - don't forget to put navi\_\_properties on hover contents
2. Switch some button elements to anchor

- anchor strictly for linking to other pages
- buttons if it's behavioral actions

3. Add inline width and height to images to prevent shifting during/after page load
4. Add basic description for alt properties in image for SEO and accessibility purposes
5. Create subfolders in css

- i.e. css => atoms folder => button.css
- i.e. css => block folder => nav.css
